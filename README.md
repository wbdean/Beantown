# Beantown

## Overview

### Motivation

I really enjoy to travel. I am approaching 49 states in the United States and have been to many major cities in the US and in Europe. With that being said, I wonder how I can use the cities I know and love in order to find where to travel when visiting a new city.

### Goal

The **goal of this project** is to use data from areas and neighborhoods of cities to give insight into new locations for personal or discovery use.


## Data

### Airbnb

The [Airbnb Datasets](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) provide insight into many cities in the United States and other countries and can be used to find areas where residents and housing are similar.

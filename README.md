## Overview

### Motivation

I really enjoy to travel. I am approaching visiting 49 states in the United States and have been to many major cities in the US and in Europe. I aspire to visit all places around the world but I wonder how I can use the cities I know and love in order to find where to travel next and where to go when visiting a new city.

### Goal

The **goal of this project** is to use data from areas and neighborhoods of cities to give insight into new locations for personal or discovery use. In doing so, I want to use a few measures to reflect a neighborhood:

* How similar are the people, and what is the reception of the area/neighborhood.
* How do living situations compare.
* How similar is the the culture. i.e. Food, restaurants, entertainment, etc.


## Data

### Airbnb

The [Airbnb Datasets](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) provide insight into many cities in the United States and other countries and can be used to find areas where residents and housing are similar in by various standards. 

### Twitter 

Use Twitter API to get info about neighborhoods. 

### Yelp

With the [Yelp Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset), information about the business in certain areas to assess the culture of a neighborhood. There doesn't seem to be info for both Boston and Chicago so this may not be an option.

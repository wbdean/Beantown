## Overview

### Motivation

I am currently living in Boston, MA, but plan on relocating next year to Chicago. I have visited a few times but, from the large size in comparison to Boston, I have found it difficult to grasp which areas in Chicago I would enjoy let alone want to live. In general, in my recent travels, I have found difficulty exploring bigger cities. When spending a few days in a certain city, I often end up spending a lot of time traveling within the city, not having enough time to connect with the people and the cultures.

### Goal

The **goal of this project** is to use data from areas and neighborhoods of cities to give insight into new locations for personal or discovery use. In doing so, I want to use a few measures to reflect a neighborhood:

* How similar are the people, and what is the reception of the area/neighborhood.
* How do living situations compare.
* How similar is the the culture. i.e. Food, restaurants, entertainment, etc.

The question I want to answer with this project is: **What neighborhoods in Chicago are similar to the neighborhood I currently live in Boston?** That is, if I were to relocate to Chicago from Boston, what areas would I like based on my current location.


## Data

### Airbnb

The [Airbnb Datasets](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) provide insight into many cities in the United States and other countries and can be used to find areas where residents and housing are similar in by various standards. 

### Twitter 

Use Twitter API to get info about neighborhoods. 

### Yelp

With the [Yelp Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset), information about the business in certain areas to assess the culture of a neighborhood. There doesn't seem to be info for both Boston and Chicago so this may not be an option.
